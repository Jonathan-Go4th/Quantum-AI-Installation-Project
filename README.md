# Quantum AI Mini Project

This project uses **Qiskit** and **Python** to explore basic quantum circuits and simple quantum–classical experiments.

## Why Qiskit?

Qiskit (Quantum Information Software Kit) is an open-source, Python-based, high-performance software framework for quantum computing, originally developed by IBM Research and first released in 2017. It provides tools to build quantum programs (by defining quantum circuits and operations) and run them on real quantum hardware or on classical simulators.

Qiskit is widely used because current quantum computers are still in early development, noisy, and expensive to operate. Simulating quantum circuits on classical computers allows developers and researchers to design, test, and optimize quantum algorithms before executing them on actual quantum devices.
